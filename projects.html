  <p>SI 110 Final Project: Occupy Social Media.<br/><br/>
    This was my final project in SI 110: Introduction to Information Studies.  The assignment
    was to evaluate a social media platform or online community through the conceptual
    framework of the course.  I then had to make an argument about my chosen social
    media site/service based on my experiences, supporting that argument with evidence
    (your direct observations of the site as a first time user; screenshots; relevant third party sources).
    On this assignment I received 200/200.</p>

  <p>SI 206 Final Project.<br/><br/>
  This was my final project in SI 206: Data Oriented Programming.  In the first part of this assignment,
  my group members and I had to access two websites or API's of our choice (we chose Spotify, TicketMaster, and
  Amazon Music).  We then had to access and store 100 items in a database from each website or API.  We were
  limited to taking 20 or less items at a time.  Once we collected the data, we then had to select some portion of
  the data from our database and do a calculation.  Once complete, we had to create three visualizations to represent
  the data that we found.</p>

  <p>Independent Study<br/><br/>
    Through my Independent Study, I wrote my own code to create a machine learning algorithm.
    I used this algorithm to train my machine to recognize the difference between two subreddits on Reddit.
    In my paper, I analyze the difference between these two subreddits based on the results from my algorithm.
    My algorithm produced results such as the most common words used in each subreddit.  In my paper, I go into
    further detail on how my algorithm actually works.</p>
