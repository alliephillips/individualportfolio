      <div class = "myexperience">
      <h4>Senior Editor, The Michigan Daily</h4>
      <h5>January 2019-Present</h5>
      <p>Currently, I am a the Senior Editor for the Social Media Section of The Michigan Daily.  The Michigan Daily is the University of Michigan largest student-run publication, along
        with Washtenaw County's only print newspaper.  In this leadership role, I am responsible for editing contributing member's draft posts for the publication's social media feeds.  I
        single-handedly train the team of 10+ members on the publication's content posting strategies to ensure consistency on all of our platforms.
        I also develop marketing strategies to enhance the team's overall presence on Facebook and Twitter, which are the two platforms that our content is posted.</p>
      <h4>Assistant Editor, The Michigan Daily</h4>
      <h5>September 2018-December 2018</h5>
        <p>I started out at The Michigan Daily as an Assistant Editor for the Social Media Section of The Michigan Daily.  In this position, I created attention-grabbing
          captions to accompany articles on all social media platforms.  The captions I created increased readership for our website and our print newspaper.  I also researched
          campus-wide competitors to develop a social media strategy to increase readership and make our publication more competitive.</p>
      <h4>Research Assistant, University of Michigan School of Information</h4>
      <h5>November 2018-April 2019</h5>
        <p>As a research assistant, I contributed to a study on the uses of artificial intelligence to detect incivility on social media platforms.
          In this particular portion of the study, we looked at the differences in post on Reddit.
          My daily duties consisted of labeling series of texts to define incivility seen online.  I labeled these texts as either disagreement/diversity or
          no disagreement/diversity.  My labels were then used to adapt technology to autonomously identified text.  Through this experience I
          gained insight on machine learning through an independent study where I created my own machine learning algorithm.  In this independent study,
          I analyzed the difference in the language used in two different subreddits.  Through the independent study I was able to better understand the mechanics of the lab.</p>
